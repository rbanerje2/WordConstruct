Developed in .NET version 4.5.2 using Visual Studio 2017.
1st longest word found in the input file is: ethylenediaminetetraacetates
2nd longest word found in the input file is: electroencephalographically
Number of words can be constructed by other words is : 97107
This application takes the path of input file as user input. However, I have set default paths for the input file, name is "_NET_Test_00.txt" which was provided to me for this evaluation.
I haven't used dependency injection as I opted for a simplier solution which requires less time to build. I can demontsrtae DI and IOC priniceples in different programs, if required.
