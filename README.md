  - 1st longest word found in the input file is: ethylenediaminetetraacetates 
  - 2nd longest word found in the input file is: electroencephalographically 
  - Number of words can be constructed by other words is : 97107 

  This program has been developed on .NET version 4.5.2 using Visual Studio 2017. 
  It takes the path of the input file as user input. However, I have set default paths for the input file to "_NET_Test_00.txt" which was provided to me for this evaluation. 
  I have chosen iterative method for it's simplicity, it may not be the most efficient in terms of performance. I can try to make it more efficient by exploring other solution approaches.
